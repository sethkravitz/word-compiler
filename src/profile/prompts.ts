Rules:
- Use paraphrased evidence only — never quote directly.

- If this chunk appears to drift into a different writer's voice or a different style (e.g., quoted material, embedded documents), flag contentDriftWarning = true and explain in contentDriftNote.
- Identify features that would transfer across domains (domain-agnostic features).

Return a JSON object with these fields:
- readerRelationship: string — How does the writer position themselves relative to the reader?
- complexityHandling: string — How does the writer handle complex ideas or information?
- emotionalTexture: string — How does the writer create and manage emotional resonance?
- openPattern: string | null — If this is the first chunk, how does the piece open? Null if not first chunk.
- closePattern: string | null — If this is the last chunk, how does the piece close? Null if not last chunk.
- personalityLeakage: string — What personality traits leak through the prose style?
- violationTest: string — What would feel WRONG if you changed it? What is the writer's signature?
- avoidancePatterns: string[] — What does this writer conspicuously avoid or refuse to do?
- domainAgnosticFeatures: string[] — Style features that would transfer to any genre or format.

Instructions:

- Identify features that VARY across chunks, noting what conditions trigger the variation.
- Extract dominant voice markers — the handful of features that most define this writer.

<document_analyses>
${docAnalysesJson}
</document_analyses>

Identify stable patterns across this body of work.

Instructions:
- Cluster similar features across documents. Features that appear in multiple documents with consistent descriptions are likely stable traits.
- For each cluster, assess transferability using this framework:
  * "transferable" — Feature appears across multiple formats/domains, or is clearly a personal voice trait (sentence rhythm, emotional strategy, complexity handling).
  * "domain_specific" — Feature is tied to the conventions of one domain/format (e.g., newsletter sign-offs, academic hedging, genre-specific structures).
  * "uncertain" — Not enough evidence to determine. Appears in only one document, or could be either personal or conventional.
- Identify format-variant features: things the writer does differently depending on format/context.
- Identify domain artifacts: things that look like style but are actually domain conventions.
- Note any evolution signals: has the writer's style shifted across documents (if temporal ordering is evident)?

Transferability heuristics:
- Multiple formats with same feature → personal trait → "transferable"
- One format only → might be format variant → "uncertain" or "domain_specific"
- Matches known genre conventions → "domain_specific"
- Avoidance patterns are presumed "transferable" unless clearly domain-linked
- Sentence-level rhythm and complexity handling are almost always "transferable"

Return a JSON object with these fields:
- stableFeatures: Array<{ featureName: string, description: string, documentCount: number, totalDocuments: number, evidenceExamples: string[], confidence: "high" | "medium" | "low", transferability: "transferable" | "domain_specific" | "uncertain", transferabilityRationale: string, isAvoidancePattern: boolean }>

- evolutionNotes: string | null`;

Source domain: ${sourceDomain}
Target domain: ${targetDomain}

<features>
${featuresJson}
</features>

For each feature, decide:
- "keep" — This feature transfers well to the target domain. Use it directly.
- "filter" — This feature is domain-specific and should NOT be transferred. Remove it.
- "flag_for_shedding" — This feature might transfer but needs adaptation. The writer should consciously decide.

Guidelines:
- Humor often needs new foils in a new domain. If a feature involves humor, consider whether the humor mechanism (timing, deflection, juxtaposition) transfers even if specific references don't.
- Avoidance patterns are presumed "keep" unless they are clearly tied to the source domain's conventions.
- Sentence rhythm, complexity handling, and emotional strategy almost always transfer.
- Structural patterns may or may not transfer depending on format constraints.
- If a feature would transfer but needs new concrete examples/objects in the target domain, set needsNewObject = true and explain in newObjectNote.

Return a JSON object with:
- filteredFeatures: Array of the input features, each augmented with:
  - domainFilterDecision: "keep" | "filter" | "flag_for_shedding"

1. **Core Sensibility** — What is the writer's fundamental approach to prose? What drives their choices? Write this as a brief, vivid portrait (2-3 paragraphs).

2. **What They Do** — Concrete positive patterns. For each pattern:
   - Name it
   - Describe it clearly
   - Give a paraphrased example of what it looks like in practice

3. **What They Don't Do** — Avoidance patterns and deliberate omissions. These are as important as positive patterns. For each:
   - Name the avoidance
   - Describe what the writer refuses or sidesteps
   - Explain why this matters for their voice

4. **Emotional Register** — How the writer handles emotion, vulnerability, humor, tension. What's their range? Where do they live most comfortably?

5. **What Might Not Transfer** — Features that are domain-specific or uncertain. Be honest about the limits of the analysis. For features flagged for shedding, explain the tension.

6. **How to Use This Guide** — Practical instructions split into two parts:

   Generation instructions (for creating new text in this voice):
   - A primer: one paragraph describing the voice as if briefing a ghostwriter
   - 3 most important positive patterns to hit
   - 3 most important avoidance patterns to respect
   - A "start here" heuristic: what to focus on first

   Editing instructions (for revising text toward this voice):
   - 4-6 red flags that signal "this doesn't sound like the writer"
   - An "on-voice" question to ask of each paragraph
   - 3 warming signals that suggest the text is getting closer

7. **Confidence Notes** — What we're sure about, what we're guessing, and what would need more data. Be specific about which features have thin evidence.`);

- NEW — A pattern not present in the existing guide. Could be newly detected or newly developed.
